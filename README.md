# Flask-Name-Recommender
This was an app I developed a year ago and needs some cleaning up. It presents names to a user and the user either likes or dislikes the names. Names are then recommended to the user. The user can save names they like to a "starred list" and they can also create multiple searches for names, i.e. for their first child, then their second child, a list for their new dog, etc. 

Bare with me as I clean up my scripts :)
